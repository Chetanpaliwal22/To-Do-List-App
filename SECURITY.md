## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

1. **Where to report:** Please create an issue in our GitHub repository detailing what you found.
2. **Response time:** We aim to confirm the receipt of your vulnerability report within 7 days of your notification.
3. **Updates:** Depending on the severity and complexity of the issue, we will keep you informed about our progress toward resolving it.
4. **Disclosure:** If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will include your name in the list of contributors (unless you prefer to remain anonymous). We will also inform the community about the vulnerability while ensuring that the disclosure does not provide enough information to exploit the vulnerability before a fix is available.

Thank you for helping to keep our project and our users safe!
